    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>Despite his parents best efforts, Dickens' family remained poor during his childhood. However, in 1816, they fortunately moved to Chatham, Kent and were free to explore the countryside and castle at Rochester. </p>
    <p> To the misfortune, the Dickens family moved to a poor community in London called Camden Town. Since John Dickens frequently overspent beyond the family's support, their financial situation became dire. John Dickens was eventually arrested due to debt in 1824. Following his father's imprisonment, Charles Dickens was forced to leave his education behind and support the family in a boot-blacking factory. Some time later, the Dickens' father paid his debt using family inheritance and Charles Dickens was permitted to return to school, only for a short period of time, since contribution was desperately necessary for his family's lacking financial income. He worked as an office boy, which would soon become a pinnacle to lead to his eventual successful career as a writer. </p>
    <p>Years following, he began reporting for London magazines and newspapers, creating sketches under the pseudonym "Boz." In 1836, his work grew as his strips began being published in the book, <i>Sketches by Boz</i>. In the same year, he created monthly installments of captions for the widely popular series, <i>The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>, with the humorous illustrator, Robert Seymour.

    <h3>Inspirations</h3>
    <p>'Oliver Twist' (1837-1838)</p>
    <p> His first novel follows Oliver Twist, who lives a youthful life in poverty, relying on his own wits to survive. Dickens' inspiration is derived from his own childhood experiences, working to contribute to his family's financial earnings. 
    <p>'The Christmas Carol' (1843)</p>
    <p>Published by Chapman & Hall, the novel features the protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge, who finds the Christmas spirit, with the help of ghosts. The novel was intended to offer social criticism, inspired by the flaws of the social class system in England.</p>
    <p>'Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son' (1846-1848)</p>
    <p>The novel was published in the form of monthly installments, centers on themes that consist of conflicts between business and personal family finances. The novel was inspired by taking darker perspective on the view of England. </p>
    <p>'David Copperfield' (1849-1850)</p>
    This novel simply followed through a character's life. Although not considered Dickens' best work, 'David Copperfield' was his favorite, amongst all of his writings. Inspired by his laborious childhood and his work as a journalist, Dickens published the book, implementing his personal experiences.
